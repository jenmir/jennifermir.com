<p>I
am originally from the Great State of Texas (!), born in Denton, and
graduated from Duncanville HS. I am a proud DHS marching band alumni
under Tom Shine, recently retired. My favorite band memory revolves
around hot Texas summers and band practice in the 105 degree August
heat, although marching in the heat was definitely NOT one of my
favorite things then. One morning I was running late and decided to
skip breakfast, and found out what a big mistake that was. During a
large "wheel rotation maneuver" I started feeling faint and managed to
pass right out on the blacktop. I don't even remember going down! But
the ever-alert (and very good-looking senior) drum major was ready to
catch me while someone else grabbed my clarinet to keep it from hitting
the ground. I only remember waking up dazed in the arms of a drum
major. Haaaah! everyone thought I was totally faking this of course,
but one should never underestimate the power of Texas heat, it's for
real
!&nbsp;</p>
<br />
I
took a long hiatus from music while attending and graduating from Texas
A&amp;M. After many world travels and a long technical career I
ended
up in NorCal and was playing in several community bands. I enjoyed the
challenge of some of the more difficult&nbsp;music that some bands
were
playing, but after many years of this I was ready for bigger challenges
and wanted to do more individualized work. I love classical music still
and play it whenever I can, but I also wanted to branch out from
clarinet and also from classical music. During a visit in Texas, my
brother
(another DHS alumni) passed me his tenor sax and I have been playing
that horn ever since. <br />
<br />
Picking up sax really opened a lot
of musical doors, especially combined with my piano training (I have
played a full 88 since I was 5), and I was busy rocking out with loud
bands at clubs and casuals for quite a few years after that. In-between
those I contined to seek
out and partner with chamber and classical musicans, going through the
classical clarinet repertoire, and playing in occasional pit shows; it
was still important to me to keep the clarinet chops up. Apart from the
polka bands and occasional Beatles songs though, there really wasn't
much in the way of opportunities for clarinet outside of the classical
world.<br />
<br />
During
a slow period I attended an Orff-Schulwerk music pedagogy program at
Mills College taught by Doug Goodkin and his crew, and attained a Level
1 Orff certification. When money was tight and my kids were little, I
taught private lessons on piano and clarinet, and also for several
months taught General Music K-4 in a San Rafael Public School. The
principal said she hired me because she really wanted someone with
piano skills who could accompany the younger kids while they were
singing, and who also could incorporate Music &amp; Movement into the
program. I also led several volunteer&nbsp;after-school music
programs,
including one for a school in the Tenderloin. I didn't have a sitter
for those so
my own kids tagged along; my youngest was only 3 months old and sat
slumped in my lap while I banged out oldies but goodies on the school's
rickety piano for the kids to sing along to. I enjoyed teaching,
but ultimately&nbsp;decided that teaching (and dealing with school
administrators) was not for me, and anyway I was more interested in
playing than teaching.<br />
<br />
A few years ago, someone in a band
I was working with in their horn section&nbsp;passed me some
recordings
of Fania All-stars and other salsa, Latin Jazz and Latin Rock.
Listening to this music from the 70's and more recent salsa and related
music, I had an epiphany:&nbsp;For a long time I had thought that
horns
in popular music were pretty much dead, including funk and rock. But
now I was hearing music with powerful horns - music that was very much
current and alive, and that I really needed to play!&nbsp; For the
first time, I decided to&nbsp;dedicate myself to learning a new
musical
language and instrumentation, that of Latin music - as a horn player
only, without touching a keyboard. I was very lucky to find the perfect
place to work on my new passion: Tony Rodriguez was just starting to
put together a new salsa project focused on the Hard
Salsa&nbsp;"Nuyorican"&nbsp;style salsa. &nbsp;This project
would eventually become Conjunto Picante and has been regularly performing in San
Francisco for several years.<br />
<br />
The
instrumentation for salsa horns generally runs with trumpets,
trombones, and sometimes a sax player and/or a flute player, or one who
does both. For some years prior to this, I had also harbored
another fantasy: learning to play the flute in any way, shape or form.
The truth was&nbsp;I could not even make one sound on a flute, and
I
felt really bad about this as a doubler.&nbsp;Playing with a salsa
band
finally gave me the really big push that I needed to get serious about
my flute playing. I currently study flute with Carmen Lemoine, a
doctoral flute candidate at Eastman, who has helped me immensely in
breaking the barriers with learning a&nbsp;difficult and
temperamental
(at least for me) instrument. And then, as if I didn't have enough work
and insanity on my plate, I was introduced to a Latin Rock/Funk band
that wanted to try someting new and bring me on - as a dedicated flute
player! My only job in this band would be to play flute, and I love it!
I still can't believe it though. <br />
<br />
That's the story up to
now. In summary, I feel incredibly blessed and lucky to be where I am
today, and also to have a supportive family behind me in all I do. My
philosophy in life is twofold : 1) never say never, and 2) never stop
exploring and learning. <br />
